# Helm repository that contains the charts for "TheBlackList"
This is a tongue in cheek application that displays my top hates and the punishment I'd meat out come the glorious revolution.
I created the github repos using the following guide:
```
https://medium.com/@mattiaperi/create-a-public-helm-chart-repository-with-github-pages-49b180dbb417
```
The helm charts use S2I from the hitlist repository, also on my account

## Adding the repository
Run the following to add this repo as a chart repository:
```
helm repo add myhelmrepo https://gary-crowe.github.io/my-helm-repository/
```
